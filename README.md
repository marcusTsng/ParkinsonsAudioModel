A mini app that can take data from audio recordings and detect early signs of Parkinson's. 


> To N_Pliers: Dependencies in requirements.txrt may have to be installed. In order to run the code for testing, open index.html in a browser (just double click the file and it should automatically do this). 
> Note - dependencies in requirements.txt may have to be installed (feel free to also make use of the venv):
``` pip3 install  -r requirements.txt```
> Note - Make sure main.py is running in the terminal before the page is opened. We will get rid of this later (refer to render.com for later development)
